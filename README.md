Iâ€™m Cash, an aspiring data analyst with experience on more than 5 technical projects. My skills include business analytics, data visualization and storytelling, Python, SQL, and Tableau. Now, I am eager to leverage my big data and visualization skills in the media & communications sphere to drive growth and boost sales.

Currently, I am managing a successful restauraunt, using metrics to measure inventory and profits. In 2025, I enrolled in the TripleTen 10-month Business Intelligence Analytics program. The curriculum covered Python (Pandas, NumPy, Beautiful Soup), data visualization (Matplotlib, Plotly, Tableau), SQL, and more. It also involved numerous practical projects.



Some facts about me:

- ðŸ“¸ I enjoy participating in professional events, especially those organized by the Data Science community.   
- ðŸ¥˜ I also love cooking, and would always prefer to eat in. 
- ðŸŽ¯ My goals for 2025: landing my dream job in data. And getting a dog!
